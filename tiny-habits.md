Set a specific time for the habit to enhance consistency.
Gradually increase the habit's complexity over time.

Rearrange your environment to facilitate habit execution.


### 3.How can you use B = MAP to make making new habits easier?
"B = MAP" is a formula proposed by BJ Fogg that represents Behavior change as a function of Motivation, Ability, and Prompt.
This formula can be used to make the process of creating new habits easier and more effective. Here's how you can apply each component of the formula to facilitate habit formation:

Behavior (B): This represents the target habit you want to establish. Clearly define the specific behavior you want to adopt as a habit.
Be specific and concise in describing the action you intend to take.

Motivation (M): Motivation refers to the desire or willingness to perform the behavior.
Increase motivation by finding intrinsic or extrinsic rewards associated with the habit. Connect the habit to a larger goal or personal value to boost motivation.

Ability (A): Ability is the ease with which the behavior can be performed. 
Make the habit as simple and easy as possible to accomplish. Break down the behavior into the smallest steps to reduce friction and resistance.

Prompt (P): A prompt is a trigger that reminds you to perform the habit. 
Create cues in your environment that prompt you to take action. These prompts can be visual cues, alarms, or associating the habit with an existing routine.

### 4. Why it is important to "Shine" or Celebrate after each successful completion of a habit?
It's important to celebrate once you've done your one tiny habit," he said. His research has found that by positively celebrating the good habit you've completed,
you have begun to create a positive emotional association with that habit, 
which improves the likelihood that you will continue to do that one thing.
