## 1.What kinds of behavior cause sexual harassment?

Sexual harassment is any unwelcome verbal, visual, or physical conduct of a sexual nature that is severe or pervasive and affects working conditions or creates a hostile work environment.

There are generally three forms of sexual harassment behavior:

1. **Verbal Harassment:** Includes comments about clothing, a person's body, sexual or gender-based jokes or remarks, requesting sexual favors, repeated asking out, sexual innuendos, threats, spreading rumors about a person's personal or sexual life, or using foul and obscene language.

2. **Visual Harassment:** Involves posters, drawings or pictures, screensavers, cartoons, emails, or texts of a sexual nature.

3. **Physical Harassment:** Encompasses sexual assault, impeding or blocking movement, inappropriate touching such as kissing, hugging, patting, stroking, or rubbing, sexual gesturing, or even leering or staring.

Each of these forms of harassment can be categorized as either:

1. **Quid Pro Quo:** This occurs when an employer or supervisor uses job rewards or punishments to coerce an employee into a sexual relationship or sexual act. It involves offering raises, promotions, or threatening demotions, firing, or other penalties for not complying with the request.

2. **Hostile Work Environment:** This happens when an employee's behavior interferes with the work performance of another or creates an intimidating or offensive workplace. It includes making repeated sexual comments that make another employee feel uncomfortable to the point where their work performance suffers or they decline professional opportunities because it would put them in contact with the harasser.

In either type of harassment, employees only need to prove that the behavior was offensive to someone, even if it was not the intended recipient. For example:

> Mike tells a dirty joke to Linda. Linda loves the joke and laughs. However, Michelle happens to be walking by when the joke is told. Michelle is offended by the joke. That joke could contribute to a hostile environment claim because Michelle, who happened to be in the area, finds the dirty joke offensive.

To determine if a company is liable for sexual harassment, two conditions need to be met:

1. Whether the employer knew or should have known about the harassment.
2. Whether the employer failed to take appropriate corrective action.

Having policies in place and an active training program can help shield employers from expensive lawsuits.





## 2.What to Do in Case of Sexual Harassment Incidents

If you face or witness any incident or repeated incidents of sexual harassment, it is crucial to take appropriate action. Here are steps you can follow:

1. **Document the incidents:** Keep a record of the dates, times, locations, and details of each incident, including what was said or done and the people involved. This documentation will be valuable if you decide to report the harassment.

2. **Ensure your safety:** If you feel threatened or unsafe, remove yourself from the situation and find a safe space. Your well-being is a priority.

3. **Talk to someone you trust:** Share your experiences with a trusted colleague, friend, or family member. They can provide support and advice on the best course of action.

4. **Review your company's policies:** Familiarize yourself with your company's sexual harassment policy and procedures. Understand the reporting process and the available resources for support.

5. **Report the incidents:** Depending on your company's policy, report the incidents to the appropriate authority, such as your supervisor, human resources department, or designated reporting channels. Provide them with your documented information and be as specific as possible.

6. **Cooperate with investigations:** If an investigation takes place, cooperate fully and provide any requested information or evidence. Be honest and accurate in your statements.

7. **Seek legal advice:** If the harassment persists or your company fails to address the issue adequately, consult with an attorney specializing in employment law to understand your legal rights and options.

8. **Take care of your well-being:** Sexual harassment can be emotionally and mentally distressing. Consider seeking support from counseling services, support groups, or professional organizations specializing in workplace harassment.

Remember, each situation is unique, and it's important to trust your judgment when deciding how to address the issue. Taking action against sexual harassment helps create safer and more inclusive work environments for everyone.
