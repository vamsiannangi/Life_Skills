## 1. Active Listening 
### What are the steps/strategies to do Active Listening? 
**Give your undivided attention:** To practice active listening, you must focus solely on the speaker and the message they are conveying. Eliminate distractions, put away electronic devices, and maintain eye contact to demonstrate your attentiveness.

**Show empathy and understanding:** Try to see the situation from the speaker's perspective and acknowledge their feelings and emotions. Use nonverbal cues like nodding and facial expressions to convey your understanding and support.

**Avoid interrupting or judging prematurely:** Let the speaker express themselves fully before offering any input or opinions. Interrupting or prematurely judging can make the speaker feel unheard and inhibit open communication.

**Use verbal and nonverbal affirmations:** Encourage the speaker to continue sharing by using verbal affirmations such as "I see,"  or "Tell me more." Additionally, nodding, smiling, and appropriate facial expressions show that you are engaged and interested.

**Practice reflective listening:** After the speaker has shared their thoughts, paraphrase or summarize what they said to confirm your understanding. This not only demonstrates that you were actively listening but also allows the speaker to clarify any misunderstandings.

**Ask open-ended questions:** Encourage further elaboration and exploration of the topic by asking open-ended questions. This shows your genuine interest in the conversation and helps the speaker feel valued.



## 2. Reflective Listening
### According to Fisher's model, what are the key points of Reflective Listening? 

**Listen Actively:** Pay full attention to the speaker and make an effort to understand their message without interrupting or judging prematurely.

**Empathize with the Speaker:** Try to put yourself in the speaker's shoes and understand their feelings and emotions related to the topic.

**Reflect Feelings and Thoughts:** After the speaker has shared their thoughts or feelings, paraphrase or summarize what you heard to confirm your understanding.

**Use Open-ended Questions:** Encourage the speaker to elaborate on their thoughts and feelings by asking open-ended questions that can't be answered with a simple "yes" or "no."

**Give Feedback:** Provide supportive and constructive feedback to the speaker, showing that you value their thoughts and ideas.

**Create a Safe Environment:** Foster a non-judgmental and comfortable atmosphere that encourages open and honest communication.


## 3. Reflection
### What are the obstacles in your listening process?
**Anxiety:** Anxiety can take place from competing personal worries and concerns.

**Laziness:** Laziness creates an unwillingness to listen to complex or detailed information.

**Physical setting:** An uncomfortable temperature, poor or nonexistent seating, bad odors, or distance between the listener and speaker can be an issue.

**The person speaking:** The person listening may become distracted by the other person’s personal appearance, mannerisms, voice, or gestures.

**Give Attention:** When someone is speaking to you, focus your attention solely on them. Avoid distractions, put away electronic devices, and maintain eye contact to show that you are fully engaged.

**Practice Active Listening:** Actively listen to the speaker's words and try to understand the underlying message. Avoid interrupting or thinking about what you'll say next while they are talking.

**Show Empathy:** Put yourself in the speaker's shoes and try to understand their perspective and feelings. Empathetic listening helps build stronger connections with others.


**Ask Clarifying Questions:** If something is unclear, don't hesitate to ask questions for clarification. This shows your genuine interest in understanding their message.


**Be Patient:** Sometimes, people may take time to express their thoughts. Be patient and give them the space to articulate their ideas.

**Seek Feedback:** Ask for feedback from friends, family, or colleagues about your listening skills, and be open to constructive criticism.

**Be Open-Minded:** Approach conversations with an open mind and a willingness to learn from others.

## When do you switch to a Passive communication style in your day-to-day life?

The passive communication style is often used by those who want to come off as indifferent about the topic at hand. They either keep their opinions to themselves or try to make it seem as if they support every piece of input in the discussion.
When speaking, passive communicators will display insecure nonverbal communication cues by not making eye contact, slouching their shoulders, or shrugging when people ask them for some input.
### Why might someone use a passive communication style?
A big motivation for using passive communication is to keep the peace, especially when dealing with conflict. While that is a nice sentiment, it can lead to some problems, usually negatively affecting the passive communicator themselves. Because they don’t properly voice their own thoughts, they can start to feel anxious, depressed, or resentful towards the words and actions of the person they are speaking with.
